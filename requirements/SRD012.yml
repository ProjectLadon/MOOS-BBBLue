  GPIO

  The Beaglebone Blue has eight free GPIO lines, including the two used for the red and green LEDs. Each of these can be connected to a corresponding MOOS variable; whether it is published or subscribed depends on the pin direction. Additionally, there are pull ups and pull downs which can be set on inputs.
